# Deactivate message tracking

Tanjun does **not** read or process your normal chat messages. Only text in commands, forms or mini-games is processed by Tanjun, as this is necessary for the bot to function.

For more information about data protection in Tanjun, click [here](./privacy-policy).

## Command to disable message tracking

To disable Tanjun's message tracking, you can use the following command:

```
/misc disable message tracking
```

### Advantages

You can use this command to further increase the privacy of you and your messages, as Tanjun does not read and ignores all your messages [(except commands and entries in e.g. Tanjun forms)](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

### Disadvantages

If you deactivate message tracking, you will no longer be able to participate in Tanjun's mini-games, for example, and the bot will not respond to your normal chat messages.

Also, by disabling message tracking, you can no longer collect XP in the level system and you can no longer participate in [some competitions](#user-content-fn-2)[^2].

## Command to reactivate message tracking

If you have deactivated message tracking in the past and have decided to reactivate it, you can do so with the following command:

```
/misc enable message tracking
```

After you have executed the command, you can participate in mini-games again and the bot will respond to your chat messages again.

[^1]: These interactions with the bot are only those that you actively and consciously engage in.

[^2]: You can no longer take part in the competitions that require you to write a certain number of messages.
