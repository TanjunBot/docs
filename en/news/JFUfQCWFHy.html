<h2>Tanjun 1.0 Release</h2>
<p>In case you haven't noticed, here's a brief explanation:</p>
<p>We decided to reprogram Tanjun from scratch a while ago. The main reason for this was outdated code in the previous version that had become difficult to maintain. It therefore seemed easier to start from scratch.</p>
<p>However, as the internal functionality of Tanjun has been fundamentally revised and improved, old configurations are no longer compatible, which is why you need to reset the bot's settings. The best way to do this is to click through our revised <a href="https://docs.tanjun.bot">documentation</a> step by step, which should make the reconfiguration relatively easy.</p>
<p>If you have used Tanjun functions that have saved a large amount of data (e.g. the level system), you can write me a DM. I will do my best to restore as much data as possible.</p>
<h2>Sorry for the lost settings</h2>
<p>We as the Tanjun team are very sorry that we were unable to migrate the old data. However, a data transfer would have meant an enormous effort, as everything would have had to be transferred manually. As an apology, every server will receive a free Tanjun Pro subscription until March 1, 2025. In addition, every user will receive the Tanjun Plus subscription free of charge until this date. From March 1, 2025, both subscriptions will then be available as paid options.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions? Is there a paywall for Tanjun?</h2>
<p>No, in fact the complete opposite! We hate paywalls and subscriptions as much as you do. Our goal is to make Tanjun accessible to everyone, with various features and without restrictions. But Tanjun also generates operating costs and other ongoing expenses, and working on Tanjun is a full-time job. Therefore, we appreciate any support. Of course, continuing to use Tanjun for free is not a problem either!</p>
