# Notes on specifying commands

When we specify commands, they often contain elements that you need to replace with something. We specify these cases as follows:

`/commandname <Required argument> [Optional argument]`

As in the example, the characters `<`, `>`, `[` and `]` indicate required and optional arguments that you have to insert yourself at this point.
